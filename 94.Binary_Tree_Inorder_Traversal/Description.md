# 94. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal
## Link:
[Binary Tree Inorder Traversal](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-inorder-traversal/description/)
## Description
Given a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

For example:
Given binary tree [1,null,2,3],
```C++
   1
    \
     2
    /
   3
```
return [1,3,2].

>Note: Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?
